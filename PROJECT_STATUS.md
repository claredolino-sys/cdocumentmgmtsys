## Technical Architecture

### Backend Architecture

```
Backend (PHP)
â”œâ”€â”€ API Router (api.php)
â”œâ”€â”€ Controllers (Business Logic)
â”œâ”€â”€ Middleware (Authentication)
â”œâ”€â”€ Config (Database Connection)
â””â”€â”€ Utils (JWT, Helpers)
```

**Design Patterns Used:**
- MVC pattern (without formal models, direct PDO)
- Service layer pattern
- Middleware pattern
- RESTful API design

### Frontend Architecture (Planned)

```
Frontend (React + TypeScript)
â”œâ”€â”€ Services (API calls)
â”œâ”€â”€ Contexts (Global state)
â”œâ”€â”€ Pages (Route components)
â”œâ”€â”€ Components (Reusable UI)
â”œâ”€â”€ Hooks (Custom React hooks)
â””â”€â”€ Utils (Helpers)
```

**Design Patterns:**
- Component-based architecture
- Context API for state management
- Service layer for API abstraction
- Custom hooks for reusable logic

---

## System Capabilities (Current)

### âœ… What Works Now

**Backend Operations:**
- User authentication (login/logout)
- Password management
- Record CRUD operations
- Department management
- User management
- Document requests
- File uploads
- Activity logging
- Analytics data retrieval
- Disposal reminders calculation
- Public documents filtering

**Can Be Tested Via:**
- Postman or similar API testing tool
- cURL commands
- Direct API calls
- Any HTTP client

### ðŸ”§ What Needs UI

All backend functionality works but needs visual interfaces:
- Dashboard visualizations
- Forms for data entry
- Tables for data display
- Charts for analytics
- File upload interfaces
- User interaction flows

---

## Deployment Readiness

### âœ… Ready for Deployment

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Complete Frontend UI (Recommended)

**Next Steps:**
1. Build layout components (TopNav, Sidebar)
2. Create dashboard page templates
3. Implement data tables and forms
4. Add charts and visualizations
5. Connect to existing backend API
6. Test all user workflows
7. Deploy to production

**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks with dedicated developer  
**Result**: Fully functional, production-ready application

### Option 2: Incremental Development

**Phase 1** (Week 1): Admin Dashboard
- Build admin layout
- Implement key admin pages
- Deploy for admin testing

**Phase 2** (Week 2): Custodian Dashboard  
- Build custodian pages
- Deploy for custodian testing

**Phase 3** (Week 3): Staff Dashboard + Polish
- Build staff pages
- Final testing and refinement
- Production deployment

### Option 3: Alternative Frontend

Use the existing backend API with:
- Different frontend framework (Vue.js, Angular)
- Mobile app (React Native, Flutter)
- Desktop application (Electron)

**Advantage**: Backend is framework-agnostic and ready to use
